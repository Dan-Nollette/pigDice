## Description

_This page starts off with displaying a roll, hold and new button.  Player one begins the game by pressing the roll button. If they rolled a one, a text pops up and reads SORRY! you rolled a 1.  You're turn is over and you don't get any points for the turn; otherwise the text pops up and tells the player what they rolled, what their total rolled amount is and tells them to click roll or hold buttons to continue. If the player presses the roll button the display will repeat depending on what they rolled.  If they press Hold, the display will say Total of (number total) has been added to your score. It's next Player's turn and the total of the turn score is added to the players total.  If you press the new button the game starts over, clearing all value._
